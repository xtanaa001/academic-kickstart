I am a postdoc at the [Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca), [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), hosted by Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/). 

Prior to my current position, I obtained my Ph.D. in electronic and computer engineering from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/). From Oct. 2015 to April 2016, I was also affiliated with the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Harvard University, hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/).


I am broadly interested in the **optimization of networked systems**, with major applications to [computer networks](/research/#computer-networks), [cloud computing](/research/#cloud-computing) and [smart grid](/research/#smart-grid). My research primarily focuses on analyzing and optimizing the performance of networked systems in the presence of self-interested users, where the design of incentives tends to play an important role in encouraging user interactions so as to achieve system optimum. 

I also study the algorithmic aspects of **incentives and online decision-making**, with a focus on understanding the interplay between mechanism design, online algorithms, and  machine learning. For more details about my work, please see [Research](/research) page.
