# My research centers on the development of algorithms for networks in the face of changing and possibly unpredictable and strategic environments.

# ranging from changing and possibly unpredictable and strategic user behaviors, to network connectivity and resource availability (e.g., intermittency of renewable energy) [communication/energy networks](/research/#projects)

# My research centers on the development of online/distributed algorithms and economic incentives to cope with dynamic and possibly strategic user behaviors in networks of various types.

# I am interested in [algorithms and economics of networks](/research), with particular focus on [communication and energy networks](/research/#projects).

# My research can be summarized by three keywords: **networks**, **algorithms**, and **economics**. 
# rom online algorithms, distributed algorithms, and algorithmic game theory.   

# My research centers on optimizing the performance of networks in the presence of private data held by self-interested agents, using tools from mathematics, computer science and economics.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, [University of Toronto](http://someurl), hosted by Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/). 

I received my Ph.D. degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering from [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk), advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/). From Oct. 2015 to April 2016, I was also affiliated with the School of Engineering and Applied Science, [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/).

I design [incentive-aware decisions](/research/#incentives) for resource allocation and scheduling in [networked systems and platforms](/research/#applications). The main application area of my research includes [computer networks](/tags/networking), [cloud computing](/tags/cloud-computing), [smart grid](/tags/smart-grid) and [smart mobility](/tags/smart-mobility).
