abstract: In this paper, we study resource allocation (including power and computation resources) and channel assignment in an uplink Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-based Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system. Our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of all users. The problem, however, is a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem. We first investigate the hidden convexity by reformulating the resource allocation problem when the channel assignment is given, and propose an efficient algorithm to allocate the resources by dual decomposition methods. Furthermore, we design a heuristic algorithm to decide the channel assignment leveraging the structural property in the reformulation. Extensive simulations verify that NOMA has great advantages over Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) in multi-user latency-intensive MEC systems.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: This paper concerns the mechanism design for online resource allocation in a strategic setting. In this setting, a single supplier allocates capacity-limited resources to requests that arrive in a sequential and arbitrary manner. Each request is associated with an agent who may act selfishly to misreport the requirement and valuation of her request.
