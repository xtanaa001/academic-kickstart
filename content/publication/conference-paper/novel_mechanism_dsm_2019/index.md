abstract: We study a general online resource allocation problem, where a service provider sells multiple types of capacity-limited resources to heterogeneous customers that arrive in a sequential manner. The provider charges payment from customers who purchase the resource but must pay an increasing marginal supply cost with respect to the total resource allocated (e.g., production costs and/or operational costs). The goal is to maximize the social welfare, namely, the total valuation of customers minus the total supply cost of the provider. We adopt the standard competitive analysis framework and provide an optimal online posted-pricing mechanism. Our online mechanism is optimal in the sense that no other online algorithms can achieve a better competitive ratio.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper concerns the mechanism design for online resource allocation in a strategic setting. In this setting, a single supplier allocates capacity-limited resources to requests that arrive in a sequential and arbitrary manner. Each request is associated with an agent who may act selfishly to misreport the requirement and valuation of her request.
