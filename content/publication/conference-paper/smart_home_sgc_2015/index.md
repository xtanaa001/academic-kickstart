abstract: The concept of smart home has attracted considerable attention in recent years, and energy management is one of its key component. This attributes to the growing concern in environmental protection and energy conservation, as well as the demands for big data collection from utility companies and policy makers. Current solutions often approach this problem by either the centralized non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or the decentralized smart controls but seldom both, rendering them impractical to some extent. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of smart home energy management systems incorporating both approaches, so that accurate power consumption monitoring and intuitive interaction with the home appliances are simultaneously achieved. The smart components directly control the appliances, while the central controller coordinates the data collection and communication. The key feature is the capability of automatically mapping the appliances to their corresponding sockets, reducing the necessity for manual initial setup. Numerical simulations prove the accuracy and efficiency of the framework. We believe that our systems, if widely deployed, can benefit not only individual households by saving energy bills and simplifying life but also society by the big data generated.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: This paper concerns the mechanism design for online resource allocation in a strategic setting. In this setting, a single supplier allocates capacity-limited resources to requests that arrive in a sequential and arbitrary manner. Each request is associated with an agent who may act selfishly to misreport the requirement and valuation of her request.
