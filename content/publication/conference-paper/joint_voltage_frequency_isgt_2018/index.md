abstract: This paper proposes a novel electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling mechanism by controlling active and reactive charging power of EVs to provide joint voltage and frequency regulation (JVFR) in the distribution network. The objective of the scheduling problem is to minimize the net cost of the distribution system operator (DSO) for operating the distribution grid in the presence of both wind-based renewable generation and EV charging stations. We test the method on a 34-bus radial distribution network for different levels of VAR requirements of wind DG units to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed JVFR approach. The simulation results show that this JVFR greatly reduces the cost of DSO in comparison with Volt-VAR Optimization (VVO) technique, which is traditionally used to optimize voltage and minimize losses of a distribution network.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: This paper concerns the mechanism design for online resource allocation in a strategic setting. In this setting, a single supplier allocates capacity-limited resources to requests that arrive in a sequential and arbitrary manner. Each request is associated with an agent who may act selfishly to misreport the requirement and valuation of her request.
