# I design incentive-aware online decisions for the optimization of networked systems and platforms in the presence of self-interested agents and dynamics. 

# Recent Publications: My research centers around designing incentive-aware decisions for the resource allocation and scheduling of networked systems and platforms, where self-interested agents may appear sequentially, interact and possibly pursue conflicting objectives.

# I study the interplay between mechanism design, machine learning and online algorithms, with a focus on applications in networked systems and markets.

I study **Online Decision-Making and Incentives**, and focus on understanding the interplay between mechanism design, online algorithms, and machine learning.  Current topics of interest include [online mechanism design](/research/#online-mechanism-design) and [online learning](/research/#online-learning).

I am also interested in problems emerging from **Networked Systems** where the interaction between incentives, learning and algorithms provides rich insight into the design of real platforms and markets in the presence of self-interested agents. My main applications include [computer networks](/research/#computer-networks), [cloud computing](/research/#cloud-computing) and [energy systems](/research/#energy-systems).
